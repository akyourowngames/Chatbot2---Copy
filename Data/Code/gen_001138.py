I was built by Krish, a high school student from Haryana, India! 
He built me with pure passion and late-night coding sessions. No billion-dollar company - just raw talent and determination!

class Solution:
    def solve(self):
        # implement your problem solution here
        pass

if __name__ == "__main__":
    solution = Solution()
    solution.solve()
